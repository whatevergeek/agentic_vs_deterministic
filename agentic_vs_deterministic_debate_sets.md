# Agentic AI vs. Deterministic AI Workflows - Debate Document Sets

**The Core Distinction:** Both approaches leverage AI intelligence, but differ in control paradigms:
- **Agentic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal → Let AI determine its own path to achieve it
- **Deterministic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal + prescribed steps → AI follows controlled path

## Design Principles Applied

### Tension Maximization
- Each subtopic presents genuine dilemmas with no clear "right" answer
- Arguments are balanced to create authentic debate tension
- Real-world consequences highlighted for both approaches

### Audience Engagement
- Different sets use vocabulary and examples relevant to target audiences
- Debate complexity matches audience technical sophistication
- Polling questions designed to split audiences for maximum engagement

### Debate Format Optimization
- Each subtopic structured for 5-7 minute debate segments
- Clear "Pro-Agentic" vs "Pro-Deterministic" argument positions
- Compelling real-world examples and case studies included

### Polling Strategy
- Questions designed to avoid obvious answers
- Multiple dimensions explored (technical, business, ethical)
- Results will reveal audience priorities and risk tolerance

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Select Based on Audience:** Choose the set that best matches your event's primary audience
2. **Mix and Match:** Combine subtopics from different sets for diverse perspectives
3. **Customize Examples:** Adapt industry examples to match your specific audience
4. **Test Polling:** Review polling questions to ensure they'll generate meaningful splits

## Event Format Suggestions

- **Opening:** Brief explanation of the debate format and polling mechanism
- **Per Subtopic:** 3 min Pro-Agentic, 3 min Pro-Deterministic, 1 min audience poll
- **Closing:** Aggregate results discussion and audience Q&A
