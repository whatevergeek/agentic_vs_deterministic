# Agentic AI vs. Deterministic AI Workflows: Debate Resources

Repository containing debate materials and event planning resources for exploring the tensions between agentic AI systems and deterministic AI workflows.

**The Core Distinction:** Both approaches leverage AI intelligence, but differ in control paradigms:
- **Agentic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal → Let AI determine its own path to achieve it
- **Deterministic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal + prescribed steps → AI follows controlled path
