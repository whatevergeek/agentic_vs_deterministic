# Business Risk & ROI Debates: Agentic AI vs. Deterministic AI Workflows

**The Core Distinction:** Both approaches leverage AI intelligence, but differ in control paradigms:
- **Agentic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal → Let AI determine its own path to achieve it
- **Deterministic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal + prescribed steps → AI follows controlled path

Basel III compliance requires extensive documentation of risk management decisions. Regulators are scrutinizing AI usage in financial institutions.

**The Tension:**  
**Deterministic AI Workflow**: AI generates compliance documentation following prescribed regulatory templates, minimizing audit costs through clear decision trails and predictable evidence that regulators can easily verify.

**Agentic AI Workflow**: AI proactively monitors regulatory changes and adapts compliance procedures autonomously, potentially identifying risks before they become violations but creating complex audit trails that challenge traditional regulatory review processes.

**No Clear Winner:**  
Should AI compliance strategy focus on minimizing audit costs through predictable processes, or invest in proactive AI risk management that might prevent costly violations but complicate regulatory relationships?

**Polling Question:**  
"For AI compliance strategy, prioritize: **AI-streamlined audit cost minimization** or **AI-proactive risk prevention**?"
