# Security & Trust Debates: Agentic AI vs. Deterministic Workflows

---

## 1. Attack Surface: Predictable Vulnerabilities vs. Dynamic Threat Landscape 🎯

### The Tension
Security requires understanding and managing attack vectors. Deterministic workflows create predictable attack surfaces that security teams can analyze, harden, and defend systematically. Agentic systems introduce dynamic behaviors that might confuse attackers but also create unpredictable vulnerabilities that security teams struggle to anticipate and defend.

### No Clear Winner
Is security stronger with predictable attack surfaces that can be systematically defended, or with dynamic behaviors that confuse attackers but create unpredictable risks?

### Polling Question
"For attack surface management, prioritize: **Predictable systematic defense** or **Dynamic unpredictable behavior**?"

## 2. Privilege Escalation: Explicit Access Controls vs. Contextual Permission Intelligence 🔐

### The Tension
Access control requires balancing security with operational efficiency. Deterministic workflows use explicit role-based access controls that prevent privilege escalation through clear permission boundaries. Agentic systems can make contextual permission decisions that might be more appropriate but could be manipulated through prompt injection or social engineering.

### No Clear Winner
Should access control rely on explicit permission boundaries that prevent escalation, or contextual intelligence that adapts permissions but might be manipulated?

### Polling Question
"For access control, use: **Explicit role-based permissions** or **Contextual intelligent permission decisions**?"

## 3. Data Exfiltration: Controlled Data Flows vs. Intelligent Data Protection 📊

### The Tension
Data protection requires preventing unauthorized access and exfiltration. Deterministic workflows control data flows through explicit rules and monitoring that can detect unusual patterns. Agentic systems can understand data context and adapt protection measures, potentially better security but with less predictable data handling that might mask exfiltration attempts.

### No Clear Winner
Is data protection more effective through controlled flows with explicit monitoring, or through intelligent protection that adapts to context but with less predictable behavior?

### Polling Question
"For data protection, rely on: **Controlled explicit data flows** or **Adaptive intelligent data protection**?"

## 4. Incident Response: Playbook Execution vs. Adaptive Threat Response 🚨

### The Tension
Security incidents require rapid, appropriate responses. Deterministic workflows execute established incident response playbooks that ensure consistent, tested procedures. Agentic systems can adapt response strategies based on threat context and system state, potentially more effective but with less predictable response procedures.

### No Clear Winner
Should incident response prioritize tested playbook consistency, or adaptive strategies that might be more effective but less predictable?

### Polling Question
"For incident response, use: **Established tested playbooks** or **Adaptive contextual response strategies**?"

---

## 5. Threat Intelligence: Signature-Based Detection vs. Behavioral Analysis 🔍

### The Tension
Threat detection requires identifying both known and novel attacks. Deterministic workflows use signature-based detection that reliably identifies known threats with minimal false positives. Agentic systems can analyze behavioral patterns to detect novel attacks but might generate more false positives or miss attacks that don't fit learned patterns.

### No Clear Winner
Is threat detection more effective through reliable signature-based methods, or through behavioral analysis that might catch novel threats but with less predictable accuracy?

### Polling Question
"For threat detection, prioritize: **Reliable signature-based detection** or **Adaptive behavioral pattern analysis**?"

## 6. Supply Chain Security: Vendor Verification vs. Dynamic Trust Assessment 🔗

### The Tension
Supply chain security requires managing third-party risks. Deterministic workflows use systematic vendor verification processes that ensure consistent security standards across suppliers. Agentic systems can continuously assess vendor trustworthiness based on behavior and context, potentially more current but with less systematic verification.

### No Clear Winner
Should supply chain security rely on systematic vendor verification processes, or dynamic trust assessment that adapts to changing conditions?

### Polling Question
"For supply chain security, use: **Systematic vendor verification** or **Dynamic continuous trust assessment**?"

## 7. Cryptographic Key Management: Deterministic Protocols vs. Adaptive Key Intelligence 🗝️

### The Tension
Cryptographic security requires proper key management and rotation. Deterministic workflows follow established cryptographic protocols with predictable key lifecycles and rotation schedules. Agentic systems could potentially adapt key management based on threat intelligence and usage patterns, but might introduce vulnerabilities through non-standard practices.

### No Clear Winner
Is cryptographic security stronger with established protocols and predictable key management, or with adaptive key intelligence that responds to threats?

### Polling Question
"For cryptographic security, rely on: **Established deterministic protocols** or **Adaptive threat-responsive key management**?"

---

## 8. Security Monitoring: Rule-Based Alerting vs. Intelligent Anomaly Detection 📡

### The Tension
Security monitoring requires detecting suspicious activities effectively. Deterministic workflows use rule-based alerting systems that generate predictable alerts for known suspicious patterns. Agentic systems can detect subtle anomalies that rules might miss but could generate false positives or miss attacks that appear normal to AI models.

### No Clear Winner
Should security monitoring prioritize predictable rule-based alerts, or intelligent anomaly detection that might catch subtle threats but with less predictable accuracy?

### Polling Question
"For security monitoring, use: **Predictable rule-based alerting** or **Intelligent adaptive anomaly detection**?"

---

## 9. Compliance Auditing: Systematic Evidence Collection vs. Intelligent Compliance Assessment 📋

### The Tension
Security compliance requires demonstrating adherence to standards and regulations. Deterministic workflows systematically collect compliance evidence that auditors can verify against established frameworks. Agentic systems could provide more comprehensive compliance assessment but might not generate evidence in formats that traditional auditing processes can validate.

### No Clear Winner
Is compliance better achieved through systematic evidence collection that fits audit frameworks, or through intelligent assessment that might be more comprehensive but less auditable?

### Polling Question
"For compliance auditing, prioritize: **Systematic auditable evidence collection** or **Comprehensive intelligent compliance assessment**?"

## 10. Zero Trust Architecture: Explicit Verification vs. Contextual Trust Intelligence 🛡️

### The Tension
Zero trust security requires continuous verification of access requests. Deterministic workflows implement explicit verification steps that check credentials and permissions systematically. Agentic systems can make contextual trust decisions based on behavior patterns and risk assessment, potentially more nuanced but with less transparent trust decisions.

### No Clear Winner
Should zero trust implementation rely on explicit systematic verification, or contextual intelligence that makes nuanced trust decisions but with less transparency?

### Polling Question
"For zero trust security, implement: **Explicit systematic verification** or **Contextual intelligent trust decisions**?"
