# BMAD Party Mode Chat Transcript: Agentic vs Deterministic AI Debate Document Updates

**Session Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Participants:** Paul (User), Mary (Analyst), Winston (Architect), Sophia (Storyteller), Caravaggio (Presentation Master)  
**Objective:** Update all debate documents with refined AI-vs-AI definitions and investment banking scenarios

## Session Overview

Paul requested updates to all debate documents based on refined definitions:
- **Agentic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal → Let AI determine its own path to achieve it
- **Deterministic AI Workflow**: Give AI a goal + prescribed steps → AI follows controlled path

Key requirements:
- Both approaches must clearly use AI intelligence
- Focus on investment banking, software architecture, and software development use cases
- Update all 10 debate document sets
- Generate chat transcript for review
